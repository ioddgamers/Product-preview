This is my solution to the https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/product-preview-card-component-GO7UmttRfa challenge.

I'm expected to recreate this Desktop and mobile design respectively using HTML and CSS:

While writing the code for this, I employed the use of multiple flexboxes to facilitate the display of different elements 
of the design. The live website can be viewed here. https://ioddgamers.github.io/Product-preview/
